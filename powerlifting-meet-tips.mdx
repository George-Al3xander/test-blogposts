In powerlifting, each cycle has a goal that must be achieved. The goal is to get stronger, period. You're forced to train smarter and become more disciplined. Train with purpose: those three words can truly become your driving force. The result in numbers is something you can see. However, I'm talking about competitive powerlifting. Where you realize and achieve the final goal under competition conditions or, in simple words, where your result is officially approved by external parties. This is psychologically important and gives you a visible barrier that you must overcome again and again.

And here are a couple of tips that I could give to those who decide to compete for the first time.

1. **Don't cut weight before competitions**

   Weight cutting is the biggest mistake I see novices make when preparing for their first competitions. For the first time, it's enough to simply train and peak for the competition. As you progress and peak for the competition, usually the intensity increases, and even though the training volume decreases, your body is at the limit of its capabilities. And if at this moment you start intentionally cutting weight, your body undergoes double stress and the chance of ending up with an injury or being disappointed, getting a blow to your mood right from the start, increases significantly. Weight cutting is a complex procedure that definitely should not be combined with your first performance. By doing this, you only shift the focus away from important things, such as technique, proper setup, to how many grams you still have left.

2. **Don't wait until you become strong enough.**

   I constantly hear this from people: "I want to wait until I can squat 500kg or deadlift 1000kg before I compete for the first time." Funny thing is, they often end up waiting so long that the competition day may never come.

   The most fun part of powerlifting is setting your own goals and breaking your own personal records. If these are your first competitions, then these are your personal records and goals. Waiting for "the moment X" is just an excuse. The truth is, nobody cares what you lift - everyone is focused on beating their own personal records, not yours. In other words, you're not as important as you think - just go out there and lift yours. And maybe you'll find in the warm-up area the company that will only support you and encourage you to move forward.

3. **Set Realistic Goals**

   Setting realistic goals is crucial, and often requires a coach or a reliable and experienced training partner to help with this. If you've lifted 400kg and set your next goal to be 500kg by the end of an eight-week peaking cycle, disappointment awaits you. Progress of around 5% over a full cycle (usually 10-16 weeks) is quite adequate and realistic for most.

4. **Don't Miss Your Peak**

   For most athletes, a five to eight-week peak cycle is sufficient. Just make sure you decrease volumes as you approach the competition. Performing a lot of accessory work and additional volume makes no sense in your last two to three weeks before the competition. But what's more important, you can't drag out this part of the preparation, otherwise you'll burn out and won't be able to realize your maximum on the platform.

5. **Learn all the commands**

   Many people encounter a problem when they face the judges. They don't understand what the judge is saying and why the red lights are flashing. Read the rules, learn the commands, review how your equipment should look, and so on.

6. **Plan and don't take risks**

   You're not playing for a cow, and your task is to make as many successful attempts as possible on your first try, not to set a city record. So you should have a clear plan for attempts, where a small margin for error can only be allowed on the third attempts. Start with weights no more than 85-90% of your 1RM, so that your first attempts are 100% successful. In simple terms, start with what you lifted for 3 or 4 reps. The feeling of confidence in your first weight is important and prepares you for further success in implementation.

7. **Take and prepare a handler**

   It wouldn't hurt if you took a friend for the last couple of workouts; they will hand you the bar during bench press, give you a sniff of ammonia before your attempt, and control your gear. In simple terms, they will rehearse what you will do on the platform. This is more important than it may seem. They will help you keep track of the flow of athletes so that you warm up and prepare for your attempt on time. They will request the next weight while you catch your breath after your attempt.

And most importantly - relax. You've lifted so much in the gym not to be nervous on the platform. Be confident in your actions. And enjoy it. That's why you're here.
